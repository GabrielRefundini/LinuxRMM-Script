## 📥 Script Download & Setup

Download the script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerdy-Technician/LinuxRMM-Script/refs/heads/main/rmmagent-linux.sh
```

Make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x rmmagent-linux.sh
```

<a id="fix-blank-screen-ubuntu"></a>

## 🖥️ Fix Blank Screen for Ubuntu Workstations (16+)

Ubuntu uses **Wayland** by default, which may cause **MeshCentral** remote desktop sessions to display a blank screen.

Run the following commands to switch back to X11:

```bash
sudo sed -i '/WaylandEnable/s/^#//g' /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
sudo systemctl restart gdm
```

> 🔹 On Ubuntu 19 and earlier, the file path is `/etc/gdm/custom.conf`.

After restarting, remote desktop functionality will work properly.

<a id="automatic-architecture-detection"></a>

## ⚙️ Automatic Architecture Detection

The script automatically detects system architecture using `uname -m` and maps it to the correct agent type:

* `x86_64` → **amd64**
* `i386` / `i686` → **x86**
* `aarch64` → **arm64**
* `armv7l` → **armv6**
* `armv6l` → **armv6**

If the architecture is unrecognised, the script exits safely with an error message.

<a id="install-the-agent"></a>

## 🚀 Install the Agent

Run the script with the following syntax:

```bash
./rmmagent-linux.sh install 'Mesh Agent URL' 'API URL' ClientID SiteID 'Auth Key' 'Agent Type'
```

### Parameters:

1. **Mesh Agent URL** – Provided by MeshCentral (`Add Agent > Installation Executable Linux/BSD/macOS`). Copy only the base URL, leaving out install flags.
2. **API URL** – TacticalRMM API endpoint, usually `https://api.example.com`.
3. **Client ID** – Visible when hovering over the client name in TacticalRMM.
4. **Site ID** – Visible when hovering over the site name in TacticalRMM.
5. **Auth Key** – Generated under `Agents > Install Agent (Windows) > Manual`. Copy the value after `--auth`.
6. **Agent Type** – `server` or `workstation`.

### Example:

```bash
./rmmagent-linux.sh install 'https://mesh.example.com/meshagents?id=XXXXX' 'https://api.example.com' 3 1 'XXXXX' server
```

⏳ *Note: Compilation may take several minutes depending on hardware. Please be patient.*

<a id="prettier-simple-output"></a>

## 🎨 Prettier `--simple` Output

The script supports a `--simple` flag to make installation output cleaner and more readable.

### Usage:

```bash
sudo bash rmmagent-linux.sh --simple install 'Mesh Agent URL' 'API URL' ClientID SiteID 'Auth Key' 'Agent Type'
```

### Features:

* **Color-coded messages:**
  * `[INFO]` – Blue, informational updates
  * `[OK] ✅` – Green, successful steps
  * `[ERROR] ❌` – Red, failed steps
* Spacing between sections for easier reading
* Collapsed download/compile progress to avoid clutter
* All temporary files cleanup is highlighted clearly

### Example:

```bash
[INFO] Installing Go 1.24.6 for amd64...

[OK] ✅ Go 1.24.6 installed.

[INFO] Installing MeshCentral agent for amd64...

[OK] ✅ Mesh agent installed.

[INFO] Compiling Tactical RMM agent for amd64...

[OK] ✅ Tactical RMM agent compiled.

[INFO] Installing Tactical Agent service...

[OK] ✅ Tactical Agent installed successfully.

[OK] ✅ Tactical Agent service installed and started.

[INFO] Cleaning up temporary files...

[OK] ✅ Temporary files cleaned.

<a id="update-the-agent"></a>

## 🔄 Update the Agent

To update an installed agent:

```bash
./rmmagent-linux.sh update
```
---

<a id="uninstall-the-agent"></a>

## ❌ Uninstall the Agent

To remove the agent:

```bash
./rmmagent-linux.sh uninstall 'Mesh FQDN' 'Mesh ID'
```

### Parameters:

* **Mesh FQDN** – Example: `mesh.example.com`
* **Mesh ID** – 64-character alphanumeric ID (Linux/BSD uninstall instructions in MeshCentral).

### Example:

```bash
./rmmagent-linux.sh uninstall mesh.example.com 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

⚠️ **Important Notes:**

* Only use this method if agent removal in TacticalRMM is not working.
* This process **does not remove records** from TacticalRMM or MeshCentral dashboards. Cleanup must be done manually.

## Credenziale fork — changes from upstream

This fork is pinned on purpose. Differences from `Nerdy-Technician/LinuxRMM-Script`:

* **Agent version is pinned**, not `master`. `agent_tag` / `agent_commit` at the top of
  the script select the version, and the build aborts if the tag no longer resolves to
  the expected commit (i.e. it was rewritten upstream).
* **Go tarball is checksum-verified** against the official sums from
  `https://go.dev/dl/?mode=json`, before the existing Go install is removed.
* **Work happens in a private `mktemp -d` staging dir**, not fixed paths in `/tmp`.
* **`git` is required** and checked up front, before Go or the Mesh agent are installed.
* Removed the dead `WGET_INSECURE` block.

### Bumping the agent version

The pin must match `LATEST_AGENT_VER` of the TRMM server (server v1.5.2 expects 2.11.0):

```bash
# server version: panel header, or LATEST_AGENT_VER in the server's settings.py
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/amidaware/rmmagent/git/ref/tags/vX.Y.Z \
  | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["object"]["sha"])'
```

Update `agent_tag` and `agent_commit` and commit the change, so every host installs the
reviewed version. For a one-off test without editing the script, both can be overridden
together:

```bash
AGENT_TAG=vX.Y.Z AGENT_COMMIT=<full sha> ./rmmagent-linux.sh update
```

`update` rebuilds the pinned version — it does not follow upstream releases by design.
